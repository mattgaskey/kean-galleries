# Drupal 9 Site for Galleries at Kean University

This is the repository for the Drupal 9 site for the Galleries at Kean University. This repository contains both the Storybook styleguide (/themes/custom/galleries/components) as well as the custom theme (/themes/custom/galleries/drupal and /themes/custom/galleries/templates) and modules for Drupal.

Storybook houses the CSS, Javascript, and most of the template markup that is used in the Drupal theme. CSS and Javascript changes happen in Storybook. Most template changes, including the creation of new components, also happen in Storybook.

The Drupal material in the repository is limited to the theme and custom modules.

Local development is assisted by several Docker containers, not included in this repo.

I was responsible for the creation of all Storybook components and Drupal templates, as well as any custom module and/or preprocessor development.
